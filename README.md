## Bounteous Code Challenge

For this code challenge, I have to use the reactjs library to build the profile component and the react app is named tile-card.

I have used two images for this profile component that looks identical to the actual design used, and the image were both found from the google search with minimal used of Photoshop. I have coded two components; one is for the main container of the profile component, and the other is a button component; Both components have their scss file for design purposes. Two more extra scss files which used for the listing colors variables and media queries types, and the purpose is for easy access and less variable declaration.

The profile component is currently in the display grid with a column space of 500px, and this was meant for a possible re-used component on the same page. And If that happens, the profile component will be stack into three tiles per row and will be responsive to the different devices as well. It will be two components per row in laptop view and a single per row for both tablet and mobile view. The profile component width will shrink, and the height will be extended once it reached the mobile view 400px. The follow button is also responsive by displaying an alert message.
